# Hey ðŸ¤™

I spend most of my time working on Rails + React apps, helping to productively ship features and build maintainable applications that scale and are as enjoyable to build as they are to use.

I'm currently a Senior Staff Engineer at [Parachute Health](https://parachutehealth.com). I was at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) before that.
